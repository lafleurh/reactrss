## Viewing a Local Demo

After running the usual `npm install`, you can run `npm start` and see a storybook demo. 

## Building for release

Run `npm run build` to create the universal bundle in `dist`. Make sure to copy the .js and .css and load the .css on your web page. The distribution runs about 12K (not counting all of React).

Packaging and pushing to npm is forthcoming.
